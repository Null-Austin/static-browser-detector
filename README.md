# Welcome!
This repository will contain code to a website, that (by plan)  wont use js or any backend (besides hosting, and sending headers) to detect what browser your on, without a api.

## How do we do it?
One example we will use is firefox and opera, firefox/opera has a unique header that allows sending style sheets via the header; and we can use that to hide or show specific content!

## Warning
This repo has no code in it yet, and its just a fun idea to plan :)
